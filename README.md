# Welcome to my GitHub dear surfer of the internet!🏄

## Here you can find information about me and what i have been up to lately!
- 👋 Hi, I’m Philipp 
- 👀 I’m interested in ... making all kinds of stuff.
- 🪑 Im a trained carpenter, transitioning to also being a programmer!🖥️
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...  Programming at 42 Heilbronn!
  * specifically C/C++
  * very currently working on the `Inception` Project, consisting of dive into system administration, working with docker , docker-compose, nginx, maraiDB and wordpress
  * also recently the cybersecurity hype got me hard and i got into CTF challenges. 🚩


- 💬 Atm I would describe myself more of a problem solver than a programmer, due to my physical and hands on background in carpentry and being quite new to programming.  
  But the combination of these two professions is promising to be bigger than the individual ones.  
  Im keen on where this jurney is taking me to! 🌞
