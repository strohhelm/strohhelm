# Welcome to my GitHub dear surfer of the internet!🏄

## Here you can find information about me and what i have been up to lately!
- 👋 Hi, I’m Philipp 
- 👀 I’m interested in ... making all kinds of stuff.
- 🪑 Im a trained carpenter, transitioning to also being a programmer!🖥️
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Programming at 42 Heilbronn!
- 🏃 Im loving bouldering and hiking!
- ✨ a few new things i learned this year:
  - Programming is similar in a way to carpentry, in the sense that you need to find solutions to problems and they have to follow fundamental rules. Other that that its pure creativity.
  - Sourdough is not that easy to get started 🥖
  - Salsa dancing is a lot of fun 💃🕺
  - I can actually learn anything quite fast if i regularly and actively put time into it.
  - Yoga is such a good counterbalance to programming and i love it!

- ⚡ Fun fact: I have not yet successfully started a sourdough from scratch yet but im not giving up! 🧑‍🍳
- 💬 At least atm I would describe myself more of a Problem Solver than a Programmer. Due to my physical and hands on background in carpentry and being quite new to programming.
  But the combination of these two professions is promising to be bigger than the individual ones.
  Im keen on where this jurney is leading me to! 🌞
